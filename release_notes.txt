NSG 1.1
=======

Upgrade from 1.0 to 1.1:

	Database upgrade:
		the upgrade requires to run script upgrade_db_1.0_1.1.sql. The scripts:
		- creates new UserAuthentication table WARNING: it will remove any previous existing table with the same name!
		- adds field Size to table DataElement
		- creates two triggers

	XNAT synchronisation:
		the XNAT sync now requires a list of the LifeRay IDs of the users to perform the sync.
